summary: Analysis of a database for a movie rental company looking to transition to online streaming service

---

<br>

**Background**: Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictitious movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

<br>

**Objective**: Provide insights to inform the launch strategy for the new online service.

<br> 

**Key questions**:

* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

* How do sales figures vary between the countries?

* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 

<br>

**Purpose and context**: This project was part of CareerFoundry’s data analytics program. Here I got hands-on experience using SQL to perform query-based analyses.

<br>

**Data**: The [database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hVzBWz5ORRbI37HA8p5tAiuZyMOe66yI/view) used for this analysis was provided by CareerFoundry. It contains data on movie rentals on the Rockbuster platform. It covers information on rentals, payments, inventory, film, customer, staff, addresses etc.

<br>

**Tools and skills**: 

* PostgreSQL

    * Database querying
    
    * Subqueries
    
    * Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  

* Tableau

    * Data Visualization	
   
    * Creating Dashboards
    
    * Presenting Results

<br>

#### Analysis:

The first step was to extract an entity relationship diagram in order to visualize the relationship between the entities in the database. This was done using DbVisualizer.

Now with an understanding of the database structure, format, and its relationships, I began looking at the data in more detail. Using PostgreSQL, I wrote queries to explore the contents of each table in the database.

Then I created a data dictionary to describe the contents and format of the database, as well as the primary and secondary relationships that exist between the various entities.

#### Answering business questions:

The next step was to query the database in order to answer specific business questions and to extract insights that would satisfy the objectives of the project. I used the ERD and the data dictionary to locate the relevant tables needed to answer each question. In PostgreSQL, I used multiple joins, subqueries, and common table expressions, where applicable, in order to generate data tables. I then exported and compiled the data to be used for visualizations in Tableau.

**Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?**

![](https://github.com/fiyinogun/fiyinogun.github.io/blob/master/img/Rockbuster%20case%20study/customerloc.png?raw=true)

I found that Rockbuster customers are spread out in 108 countries all over the world, with the highest concentration in India and China. I also noted that there are about forty countries where there is only one customer. 

<br>

**How do sales figures vary between the countries?**

Unsurprisingly, the countries that have the highest number of customers have generated the most revenue.

<br>

**Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?**

An analysis of the revenue generated by the types of genre and ratings showed that there isn’t much of a significant difference between the top earners. Sports movies have brought in the most revenue, but the other high earning genres like Sci-Fi, Animation, Drama, and Comedy aren’t too far off.

**Other findings**:

* Rockbuster has a total of 599 customers

* The average rental rate for a movie was $2.98

* The average rental duration for a movie was five days

* The total revenue generated was $61,306.

<br>

**Insights**:

When comparing the data on each customer rental, I discovered that there were quite a number of cases where the payment made by a customer exceeded the rental rate designated for each movie. After comparing the date the movie was rented and when it was returned, I found that, in these cases, the rented movies were held by the customer for more than the allowed rental duration. So, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the extra payments made by customers in these cases were late fees, although it is not exactly clear how these fees were being calculated. I was also able to determine that these extra fees make up about 30% of the total revenue generated.

<br>

**Recommendations**

Based on my findings, I recommended that the Rockbuster management should pilot the new online streaming service in the countries where it already has a large customer base. This would be in India, China, United States, Japan, and Mexico.

Rockbuster should also consider starting the service with the most popular movie titles and dropping the licenses for the least popular movies on its platform.

For revenue generation, Rockbuster would have to design a new model that would make up for all the revenue that came from late fees. A subscription model is one example. A rewards program could also be introduced to incentivize more rentals.

See the full [Tableau storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fiyin4479/viz/RockbusterMovieRentals_16809756743380/Rockbuster?publish=yes) and the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s43a4N0zInXevJ_xfQTBj47ZCAAR4rxa/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=108598248110506806753&rtpof=true&sd=true) containing all the queries used to answer business questions.

<br>

**Reflection**:

If I were to change anything in this project, it would be to investigate in more detail the countries with the largest customer base. It would be interesting to see which cities in those countries customers concentrated in, and what specific types of movies are popular in those regions. This could yield information that would help refine Rockbuster’s launch strategy.

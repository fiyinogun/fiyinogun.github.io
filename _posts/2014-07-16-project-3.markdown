title: INSTACART BASKET ANALYSIS
summary: Analysis of open-source Instacart data to identify sales patterns and customer purchasing behavior

---
 
<br>

**Background**: 

Instacart is an online grocery store looking to uncover more information about its sales pattern. They are particularly interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns. This analysis is to inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
Objectives: Derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation of data based on sales patterns and customer purchasing behavior.

<br>

**Data** : 

The data used for this analysis is a set of open-source [datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/4.3_orders_products.zip) (orders and products) from [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017). They contain information on over 30 million grocery orders in 2017. An auxiliary data set on [customer data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip) was provided by CareerFoundry for educational purposes.

#### ANALYSIS PROCESS:

I started out by exploring both datasets to gain a better understanding of their contents. I performed some data wrangling steps, including dropping unnecessary columns, renaming columns with unintuitive names, and changing data types where applicable. I continued this process by performing consistency checks on, including checking for, and renaming duplicates, and checking for missing values.

I found sixteen missing values under the product name variable in the “products” dataset. Since I had no other information on these particular products, and they made up less than one percent of the dataset, I excluded them from the rest of the data.

After checking the summary statistics for the “products” data, I found an unreasonable maximum price of $9999. I investigated this by searching for all the items with that price tag. There was only one item: “2% Reduced Fat Milk”. I went further by looking for similar items in the dataset, and I found another product with the same name, and in the same aisle and department, with a more reasonable price of $9.2 The earlier price was definitely an error, so I substituted it with the price of the other item I found.

In the “orders” dataset, I found 206,209 missing values in the “days_since_prior_order” variable. Upon further investigation, I discovered (from the “user_id” variable) that the total number of customers in the system is also 206,209, which led me to conjecture that these missing values represents the first ever order for each customer, which would explain why there is no entry for the total number of days since a prior order.

After completing all the necessary wrangling steps and consistency checks, I combined both datasets into a single data set using the common product id variable.

#### Answering business questions:

Now with the desired dataset for analysis, I began investigating the data more thoroughly in order to tackle and provide answers for the objectives of the project. This process required deriving new variables, grouping, and aggregating different variables, and visualizing various elements of the data.

<br>

**The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.**

From a simple frequency count of the relevant variables, I found that the busiest days of the week were on the weekend days: Saturdays and Sundays, while Tuesdays and Wednesdays were the least busy days of the week.

![](https://github.com/fiyinogun/fiyinogun.github.io/blob/master/img/Instacart%20case%20study/days.png?raw=true)

Using a similar process, I found that most orders are placed between 10am and 4pm. Customer spending is also highest during this period. The midnight and early morning hours have the lowest frequency of orders.

<br>

**Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.**

From a histogram of the “prices” variable, I observed that the prices of most products were less than $15 and there were very few products between $15 and the maximum price of $25. I used this data to derive a price-range group variable which could be used to better organize and segment the prices of products.

![](https://github.com/fiyinogun/fiyinogun.github.io/blob/master/img/Instacart%20case%20study/priceshist.png?raw=true)

Where the price of a product was less than or equal to $5, I flagged it as a “Low-range product”; where the price was higher than $15, I flagged it as a “High-range” product; everything else in between I flagged as a “Mid-range product”. 

![](https://github.com/fiyinogun/fiyinogun.github.io/blob/master/img/Instacart%20case%20study/pricesflag.png?raw=true)

The pie chart below shows that such “Mid-range products” above $5 and less than or equal to $15 make up most of the prices of products (67.5%), while products above $15 make up just 1.3% of product prices.

<br>

**Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.**

I found that the produce department accounts for a significant amount of orders. Dairy and eggs department is also popular. Bulk items have the least orders.

<br>

**The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.**

I initially used the maximum number of orders made by each customer to determine the level of customer loyalty. Where the maximum number of orders was ten or less, I flagged such a customer as a “New customer”; where it was above 40 orders: “Loyal customer”; everything else in between: “Regular customer”.  The regular customers make up most of the customers in the system, while new customers are the fewest.

I then used the crosstab function to compare the result of this derivation to the price range grouping I created earlier. Every customer group mostly buys products within the Mid-range price grouping (i.e., between five and fifteen dollars)

<br>

I also created another variable to categorize the spending habits of different customers. I used the average amount a customer has spent to determine if they were high or low spenders. Where the average amount spent is less than $10, I flagged such a customer as a low spender; where the average is 10 or more, I flagged the customer as a low spender. From this, I discovered that majority of the customers in the system are low spenders, spending an average of ten dollars or less.

**Conclusion**

The profile creation and data segmentation was the most involved part of the analysis, and it required experimenting with different variables and aggregations before I could develop the profiles. I experimented with customers’ age, income, state, family size, number of dependents, and specific types of products. Most of these characteristics did not produce significant insights upon comparison but I compiled a few of them in the [final report](https://github.com/fiyinogun/Instacart/blob/main/04. Sent to client/Final Report.xlsx). There are still many potential profiles to be explored and created. Since the data set was so large with many different variables, I had to limit myself to just a few characteristics to investigate.
